This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an enhancement of the original tic-tac-toe game present in the official website for React.

## Enhanced featues

- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw
